# About
This repo captures the codebase and notes for the hacking/reverse engineering of my electric sit/stand desk.

The code is flashed to a Raspberry Pi Pico W which I have built a custom module for to interface into my desk. 
This allows control of the desk through MQTT protocol, which I have interfaced through Home Assistant
